## Overview  
The **TEMPERATURE-CONVERTER** project is a console-based C++ application designed to make temperature conversions effortless. Users can input temperatures in one scale (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin) and convert them to another. This project emphasizes simplicity, accuracy, and user interaction, making it an ideal tool for educational purposes, scientific computations, or everyday temperature conversions.  

## Features  
- **Multi-scale Support**:  
  Convert between Celsius (C), Fahrenheit (F), and Kelvin (K).  
- **Interactive Design**:  
  Easy-to-follow prompts guide users through the conversion process.  
- **Accurate Calculations**:  
  Conversions are handled with precision to ensure reliable results.  
- **Input Validation**:  
  Ensures only valid temperature values and scales are processed, preventing errors.  
- **Reusability**:  
  Designed with clean and modular code, making it easy to integrate or extend.  

## How It Works  
1. The program prompts the user to:  
   - Enter a temperature value.  
   - Specify the scale of the input temperature (C, F, K).  
   - Specify the desired target scale for conversion (C, F, K).  
2. Based on the input, the program performs the necessary calculation.  
3. The result is displayed, showing the converted temperature in the target scale.
